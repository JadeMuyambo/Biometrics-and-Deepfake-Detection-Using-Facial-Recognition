# Biometrics-and-Deepfake-Detection-Using-Facial-Recognition
Built a facial recognition model using CNNs and SVMs to detect deepfake images. The model was trained on a reduced OpenForensics dataset and multiple performance metrics and data augmentation techniques were applies to evaluate and improve performance and robustness.
